## 1. Project Description

The project involves an observational study designed to assess the impact of
"Sesame Street" viewership on children's learning outcomes, particularly in
letters, numbers, and forms. The study is in the analysis stage, examining
existing data collected from children across five different sites in the United
States. Variables observed include, but are not limited to, viewing frequency,
setting, encouragement to watch, and pretest scores of vocabulary maturity
(Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test). Its objective is to determine the show's
effectiveness in educational content delivery and identify areas for
improvement. Results will be used to enhance Sesame Street's educational focus
and impact, as per the client's request for an upcoming board meeting
presentation.

## 1.1 Research Questions

**Question 1:** How does viewership of Sesame Street influence children's
learning outcomes - specifically in terms of letters, numbers, and forms
knowledge - as measured by the percent increase in post-test scores compared to
pre-test scores? Is this result consistent if we instead consider percent
achievable gain (PAG)?

**Question 2:** Which area, of letters, numbers, and forms, has the most room
for improvement? Which should Sesame street focus on improving in the future?

## 1.2 Variables

We considered a variety of variables in our preliminary analysis of the Sesame
Street study. The dataset contained several explanatory variables, but we chose
to focus on viewing frequency (Viewcat) as our main explanatory variable; and
site, sex, age, setting, and encouragement as possible confounding variables.
The dataset contained pre- and post-test scores for six different domains, but
we were only interested in scores for letters, numbers, and forms. We also
defined two possible response variables: percent increase and percent
achievable gain (PAG). The first, percent increase, is simply the difference
between the posttest score and pretest score, as percentages. The second, PAG,
is the child's improvement (post-test score minus pre-test score) divided by
total possible improvement (maximum test score minus pretest score). The goal
with this measure is to capture improvement while accounting for the fact that
advanced students cannot improve as much as those who were not as advanced to
begin with. All variables used in our analysis are summarized in the table
below. Although there were other variables included in the dataset, we decided
that these were the most important ones to answer our client's research
questions.

## 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Our exploratory data analysis of the Sesame Street study revealed promising
leads for modeling, as well as concerns about possible data issues and
confounders we will have to watch out for as we move forward. As a whole, it
appeared that Sesame Street viewership was positively correlated with greater
improvement, as measured by PAG and percent increase across all tests (letters,
forms, and numbers). The comparative improvement across tests did not appear to
have a clear trend measured by both PAG and percent increase.

While PAG is has nice theoretical properties, its use as a response variable in
this study may not be practical; it introduced more nonuniform variability in
the outcomes. In addition, exploratory analysis revealed that variance may not
be equal across all groups (particularly with regards to site), and this could
cause possible problems in modeling. More in-depth exploratory analysis is
reported below. First, we look at visualizations to answer the two primary
research questions; then, we investigate possible confounders. 

```{r}
#| label: fig-LNF1
#| echo: false
#| warning: false
#| fig-cap: "The Relationship Between Viewing Time of Sesame Street Percent Score Increase for Letters, Numbers, and Forms. Note that viewing time is categorical with higher values corresponding to more time viewing Sesame Street"
#| layout-ncol: 3

#|   - "Numbers"
#|   - "Forms"


plot <- ggplot(wideData, aes(x = viewcat, y = let_diff_pct, fill = viewcat)) +
geom_boxplot(show.legend=FALSE) +
  xlab("View Time") + 
  ylab("Percent Increase") + 
  labs(title = "Letters") 
plot

plot <- ggplot(wideData, aes(x = viewcat, y = numb_diff_pct, fill = viewcat)) +
  geom_boxplot(show.legend=FALSE) +
  xlab("View Time") + 
  ylab("Percent Increase") + 
  labs(title = "Numbers") 
plot

plot <- ggplot(wideData, aes(x = viewcat, y = form_diff_pct, fill = viewcat)) +
  geom_boxplot(show.legend=FALSE) +
  xlab("View Time") + 
  ylab("Percent Increase") + 
  labs(title = "Forms") 
plot
```

All three plots in @fig-LNF1 appear to indicate a positive linear relationship
between viewing time (categorized as levels 1-4) and percent score increase.
Although the variability is not completely consistent across viewing levels,
overall the data are relatively well-behaved. 

```{r}
#| label: fig-LNF2
#| echo: false
#| warning: false
#| fig-cap: "The Relationship Between Viewing Time of Sesame Street PAG for Letters, Numbers, and Forms. Note that viewing time is categorical with higher values corresponding to more time viewing Sesame Street"
#| layout-ncol: 3
#| fig-subcap:  
#|   - "Letters"
#|   - "Numbers"
#|   - "Forms"

plot <- ggplot(wideData, aes(x = viewcat, y = letPAG, fill = viewcat)) +
geom_boxplot(show.legend=FALSE) +
  xlab("View Time (higher value=more)") + 
  ylab("PAG") + 
  labs(title = "Letters") 
plot

plot <- ggplot(wideData, aes(x = viewcat, y = numbPAG, fill = viewcat)) +
  geom_boxplot(show.legend=FALSE) +
  xlab("View Time") + 
  ylab("PAG") + 
  labs(title = "Numbers") 
plot

plot <- ggplot(wideData, aes(x = viewcat, y = formPAG, fill = viewcat)) +
  geom_boxplot(show.legend=FALSE) +
  xlab("View Time") + 
  ylab("PAG") + 
  labs(title = "Forms") 
plot
```

Similar to @fig-LNF1, all three plots in @fig-LNF2 seem to indicate a positive
relationship between viewing time and percent score increase. However, by
comparison to the plots using percent increase as the response variable, the
data have a much wider spread with many more outliers. This could pose some
problems in future modeling. 

```{r}
#| label: fig-LNF3
#| echo: false
#| warning: false
#| fig-cap: "Comparing Percent Increase Across Three Subjects: Letters, Numbers, and Forms"
#| layout-ncol: 1


plot <- ggplot(longData, aes(x=which_test, y=diff_pct, fill=which_test)) +
  geom_boxplot(show.legend=FALSE) +
  xlab("Which Test") + 
  ylab("Percent Increase") +
  labs(title = "Percent Increase by Test") 
plot

```
The plot in @fig-LNF3 doesn't indicate a clear trend with regards to which
subject Sesame Street teaches the most effectively. The highest median is
forms, followed by numbers and then letters. However, all three boxplots have
significant overlap with each other, which means that statistical analysis will
likely not yield usable differences. 

```{r}
#| label: fig-LNF4
#| echo: false
#| warning: false
#| fig-cap: "Comparing PAG Across Three Subjects: Letters, Numbers, and Forms"
#| layout-ncol: 1


plot <- ggplot(longData, aes(x=which_test, y=PAG, fill=which_test)) +
  geom_boxplot(show.legend=FALSE) +
  xlab("Which Test") + 
  ylab("PAG") +
  labs(title = "Percent Achievable Gain (PAG) by Test") 
plot

```

Once again, it appears that PAG introduces a lot of additional variance
compared to the same plot using percent increase as the response variable. In
this case, there is clearly significant left-skew in the data with lots of
outliers. Despite this, the plot in @fig-LNF4 does appear to show similar
results as the plot in @fig-LNF3. When put on the same scale, the values appear
to be similar around the middle of the boxplot.

For simplicity, all investigation of possible confounders (below), was done
with only percent increase as response variable. 
```{r}
#| label: fig-Encour
#| echo: false
#| warning: false
#| fig-cap: "Comparing Percent Increase Across Three Subjects (Letters, Numbers, and Forms) depending on Encouragement "
#| layout-ncol: 3
#| fig-subcap:  
#|   - "Letters"
#|   - "Numbers"
#|   - "Forms"

plot <- ggplot(wideData, aes(x = encour, y = let_diff_pct, fill = encour)) +
  geom_boxplot(show.legend=FALSE) +
  xlab("Encouragement") + 
  ylab("Percent Increase") + 
  labs(title = "Letters") 
plot

plot <- ggplot(wideData, aes(x = encour, y = numb_diff_pct, fill = encour)) +
  geom_boxplot(show.legend=FALSE) +
  xlab("Encouragement") + 
  ylab("Percent Increase") + 
  labs(title = "Numbers")
plot

plot <- ggplot(wideData, aes(x = encour, y = form_diff_pct, fill = encour)) +
  geom_boxplot(show.legend=FALSE) +
  xlab("Encouragement") + 
  ylab("Percent Increase") + 
  labs(title = "Forms") 
plot

```
The plots in @fig-Encour have somewhat unclear results. Encouragement may have
an impact on percent score increase, particularly for letters, but there is
enough overlap of the boxplots in all three plots that more analysis is needed.
This may be an important confounder to consider in modeling.

```{r}
#| label: fig-Sex
#| echo: false
#| warning: false
#| fig-cap: "Comparing Percent Increase Across Three Subjects (Letters, Numbers, and Forms) depending on Sex "
#| layout-ncol: 1


plot <- ggplot(longData, aes(x = which_test, y = diff_pct, fill = sex)) + 
  geom_boxplot(show.legend=FALSE) +
  xlab("Which Test") +
  ylab("Percent Increase") + 
  labs(title = "Percent Increase by Sex")
plot
```
The plot in @fig-Sex seems to show little to no relationship between sex and
percent increase in score in any of the tests. It does not appear that sex will
be an important confounder to consider in modeling. 

```{r}
#| label: fig-Site
#| echo: false
#| warning: false
#| fig-cap: "Comparing Percent Increase Across Three Subjects (Letters, Numbers, and Forms) depending on Site "
#| layout-ncol: 1


plot <- ggplot(longData, aes(x = which_test, y = diff_pct, fill = site)) + 
  geom_boxplot() +
  xlab("Which Test") +
  ylab("Percent Increase") + 
  labs(title = "Percent Increase by Site") 
plot
```

The plot in @fig-Site shows some variation in score improvement across the
different sites for all three tests. Not only is median percent increase in
score different depending on the site, but the variability is not uniform
across groups either. This variable seems to be an important confounder, and we
will have to look out for issues with the non-uniform varibility. 

```{r}
#| label: fig-Age
#| echo: false
#| warning: false
#| fig-cap: "Comparing Percent Increase Across Three Subjects (Letters, Numbers, and Forms) depending on Age "
#| layout-ncol: 1


plot <- ggplot(longData, aes(x = age, y = diff_pct, col = which_test)) + 
  geom_point() +
  xlab("Age") +
  ylab("Percent Increase") + 
  labs(title = "Percent Increase by Age", col = "Which Test") 
plot 
```

The plot in @fig-Age seems to show little to no relationship between age and
percent increase in score in any of the tests. The points appear to be
scattered more or less at random. It does not appear that age will be an
important confounder to consider in modeling.

```{r}
#| label: fig-Setting
#| echo: false
#| warning: false
#| fig-cap: "Comparing Percent Increase Across Three Subjects (Letters, Numbers, and Forms) depending on Setting "
#| layout-ncol: 1


plot <- ggplot(longData, aes(x = which_test, y = diff_pct, fill = setting)) + 
  geom_boxplot(show.legend=FALSE) +
  xlab("Which Test") +
  ylab("Percent Increase") + 
  labs(title = "Percent Increase by Setting") 
plot
```
The plot in @fig-Setting seems to show little to no relationship between
setting and percent increase in score in any of the tests. It does not appear
that setting will be an important confounder to consider in modeling.


## 3. Statistical Analysis 

### Research Question 1: Setup
To address the first research question, we fit three multiple linear regression
models: one for each subject. The models predicted improvement using prescore,
age, viewcat, and site. The models were all of the form:
$$\text{SubjectImprovement} = \beta_0 + \beta_1\text{Prescore} +
\beta_2\text{Age} + \beta_{3 \dots 5}I_{Viewcat}+ \beta_{6\dots9}I_{Site} +
\epsilon,$$ 
$$\epsilon\sim N(0,\sigma).$$
$$\epsilon\sim N(0,\sigma_\epsilon).$$
In this model, $\beta_1$ and $\beta_2$ are attached to the two quantitative
variables, and they signify the change in predicted improvement given a unit
increase in prescore and age, respectively. The other $\beta$'s (3 through 9)
are attached to the two categorical variables, viewcat and site. The
interpretation of $\beta_3$ is the change in predicted improvement for viewcat
2 when compared to viewcat 1 (the baseline), and this interpretation extends
through to $\beta_5$. Similarly, the interpretation of $\beta_6$ is the change
in predicted improvement for site 2 when compared to site 1 (the baseline), and
this interpretation extends through to $\beta_9$. Finally, $\beta_0$ is the
intercept, and its interpretation is not important in this context. A (type II)
ANOVA table for each model is included in @tbl-anova-1, @tbl-anova-2, and
@tbl-anova-3. 

### Research Question 1: Analysis of Results
```{r}
#| label: tbl-anova-1
#| warning: false
#| echo: false
#| tbl-cap: "ANOVA table for multiple linear regression model to predict improvement in letters using viewcat, prescore, age, and site"

subset_let <- wideData[c('ID', 'site', 'sex', 'age', 'setting', 'viewcat', 'encour', 'peabody', 'prelet', 'let_diff_pct')]

let_lm <- lm(let_diff_pct ~ site + age + viewcat + prelet, data = subset_let)

knitr::kable(Anova(let_lm))
```

In this table the values that we are most interested in are the p-values on the
right-hand column. Although some values appear to be zero, they are not, but
are so small that they were rounded to zero. We will consider any p-value less
than 0.05 to be "significant," meaning we can infer that what we observe is a
product of the true process and not random chance. For the quantitative
variables of age and prescore, the small p-values indicate that each of these
variables is important for predicting improvement. For the categorical
variables of viewcat and site, the small p-values indicate that at least one of
the viewing categories and at least one of the sites resulted in a different
improvement than another. The same interpretations can be applied to the two
ANOVA tables below, which are analogous to this one but for the forms and
numbers models. 

```{r}
#| label: tbl-anova-2
#| warning: false
#| echo: false
#| tbl-cap: "ANOVA table for multiple linear regression model to predict improvement in forms using viewcat, prescore, age, and site"

subset_form <- wideData[c('ID', 'site', 'sex', 'age', 'setting', 'viewcat', 'encour', 'preform', 'peabody','form_diff_pct')]

form_lm <- lm(form_diff_pct ~ site + age + viewcat + preform , data = subset_form)

knitr::kable(Anova(form_lm))
```

```{r}
#| label: tbl-anova-3
#| warning: false
#| echo: false
#| tbl-cap: "ANOVA table for multiple linear regression model to predict improvement in numbers using viewcat, prescore, age, and site"

subset_numb <- wideData[c('ID', 'site', 'sex', 'age', 'setting', 'viewcat',
			  'encour', 'prenumb', 'peabody','numb_diff_pct')]

numb_lm <- lm(numb_diff_pct ~ site + age + viewcat + prenumb,
	      data = subset_numb)

knitr::kable(Anova(numb_lm))
```

In @fig-pairwise-let, we can observe the confidence intervals for the mean
improvement in letters stratified by category after accounting for pretest
score, age, and site. In this plot, if the red arrows for two confidence
intervals don't overlap, than we can infer that those two categories are
statistically different from each other. In this case, we can see that viewing
category 4 was associated with greater improvements than categories 1 and 2,
but similar amounts of improvement as category 3 given a particular site,
pre-score, and age. Similarly, given a particular site, pre-score, and age,
viewing category 3 was associated with greater improvements than categories 1
and 2 and viewing category 2 was associated with greater improvements than
category 1.

```{r}
#| label: fig-pairwise-let
#| echo: false
#| warning: false
#| fig-cap: "Mean Improvement in Letters by Viewing Category after accounting for site, age, and prescore "
#| layout-ncol: 1

let_means <- emmeans(let_lm, ~viewcat, adjust = 'HSD')
plot(let_means, comparisons=T, xlab = 'Mean Improvement', ylab = 'Viewing Category', main = "Mean Improvement in Letters by Viewing Category after accounting for site, age, and prescore")
```

In @fig-pairwise-form, we can observe the confidence intervals for the mean
improvement in forms stratified by category after accounting for pretest score,
age, and site. This plot can be interpreted in the same way as the one for
letters, and we can observe similar trends. 

```{r}
#| label: fig-pairwise-form
#| echo: false
#| warning: false
#| fig-cap: "Mean Improvement in Forms by Viewing Category after accounting for site, age, and prescore"
#| layout-ncol: 1

form_means <- emmeans(form_lm, ~viewcat, adjust = 'HSD')
plot(form_means, comparisons=T, xlab = 'Mean Improvement', ylab = 'Viewing Category')

```

Likewise, in @fig-pairwise-numb, we can observe the confidence intervals for
the mean improvement in numbers stratified by category after accounting for
pretest score, age, and site. Once again, the same interpretations can be
applied and the trend is similar to the other two. 

```{r}
#| label: fig-pairwise-numb
#| echo: false
#| warning: false
#| fig-cap: "Mean Improvement in Numbers by Viewing Category after accounting for site, age, and prescore "
#| fig-align: "center"
#| layout-ncol: 1

numb_means <- emmeans(numb_lm, ~viewcat, adjust = 'HSD')
plot(numb_means, comparisons=T, xlab = 'Mean Improvement',
     ylab = 'Viewing Category')
```

Effect size is a metric which tells us whether the statistical differences we find are large enough to be practically important. We calculated effect sizes with respect to viewing category for each model, and found that in all models, differences between viewing category were associated with a moderate or large effect sizes. 

## Research Question 2: Setup

To address the second research question, we fit a mixed-effects linear model
predicting improvement with subject, age, viewcat, site, and an interaction
term between subject and viewcat while accounting for the random effects of the
individual child (in the model, we call the random effect ID). The mathematical
form of this model is:
$$\text{Improvement} = \beta_0 + \beta_1\text{Age} + \beta_{2,3}I_{Subject} +
\beta_{4\dots6}I_{Viewcat} + \beta_{7 \dots 10}I_{Site} + \beta_{11 \dots
16}I_{Viewcat}I_{Site} + \gamma ID + \epsilon,$$ 
16}I_{Viewcat}I_{Site} + \gamma + \epsilon,$$ 

$$\epsilon\sim N(0,\sigma).$$
$$\epsilon\sim N(0,\sigma_\epsilon), \gamma \sim N(0, \sigma_\gamma)$$

The interpretations of $\beta_0$ to $\beta_{10}$ work the same as they did in
the previous model. However, in this model we also include an interaction term
and a random effects term. The interaction term considers the effect of viewcat
(amount of time watched) in the presence of another variable, which_test,
denoting which subject is being tested. This way, we are considering if
watching more sesame street has a unique benefit on a particular subject.
The purpose of the random effects term is to account for the correlation between scores in different subjects for any particular child. That is, a child's score in letters is likely correlated with that child's score in forms and numbers. A (type II) ANOVA table for each model is included in @tbl-anova-4. 

### Research Question 2: Analysis of Results

The Analysis of Variance table provides the significance of each fixed effect
and interaction term. Notably, the interaction term between which_test and
viewcat is highly significant (p < 2.2e-16), indicating that the amount of time
spent watching Sesame Street has a differential impact on the improvement
scores across the different test subjects. The random effects component shows
variability in the intercepts across individual children (ID), indicating that
there is significant individual difference in improvement scores that is not
explained by the fixed effects in the model. This is a good sign that a random effects model is necessary in this case. To further justify using random effects in our model, we conducted a likelihood ratio test comparing a model with and without random effects. The test resulted in a very low p-value (p < 2.2e-16), and so we confirmed that the random effects were necessary in this model. 

```{r}
#| label: tbl-anova-4
#| warning: false
#| echo: false
#| tbl-cap: "ANOVA table for mixed effects model to predict improvement in all subjects using viewcat, which_test (subject), age, and site"

mixed_model <- lmer(diff_pct ~ which_test*viewcat + site + (1|ID),
		    data = longData)

knitr::kable(Anova(mixed_model))
```


In @fig-pairwise-all, we can observe the confidence intervals for the mean
improvement stratified by which_test (subject) and viewcat after accounting for age and site. The reason that this plot is stratified by both variables is because our model has an interaction term, and so these are conditional means rather than marginal means. This plot helps us to identify which area has the lowest estimated means, signaling the most room for improvement. Visually, we see that this trend is not the same across all viewing cateogories. In viewcat 1, letters has the lowest mean improvement. In viewcat 2, the trend is not so clear since the red arrows for numbers and letters overlap with each other, so either subject could plausibly have the lowest mean improvement. In viewcat's 3 and 4, we see that either of numbers or forms have the lowest mean improvement. Since Sesame Street cares most about the effect of watching their show, the important result here is for viewing categories 3 and 4, since children who watched less of the show will presumably have been less impacted by it. 

We calculated effect sizes using Pearson's r statistic for this model with respect to the differences between the subjects, and we found that the differences between subjects had moderate effect sizes. 

<!-- While statistical significance is evident, the effect sizes [not provided] would be necessary to assess the practical significance of the findings. Large effect sizes in areas with lower improvement scores would suggest meaningful opportunities for targeted educational interventions by Sesame Street. Given the significance of the interaction effects, Sesame Street should focus on the subject area that, when viewed more, shows the least improvement [e.g. min(viewcat1:whichtest - viewcat2:whichtest); visually, it looks like forms]. This area would benefit most from enhanced educational content. -->
